# hansard-word-cloud

This is a hacky adaption of [Noel Dempsey's](https://github.com/dempseynoel/hansard-word-cloud) UK
based project to the New Zealand parliament.

It grabs the text from [Parliamentary Hansard](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/)
and removes a bunch of commonly used and procedural words and then puts the top 100 words into
a world cloud.


Currently, the automatic scheduling of the bot is through an AppleScript in conjuction with Power Manager. Advice on how to move to an alternative method is welcome.
